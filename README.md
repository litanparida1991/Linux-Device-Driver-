Linux Device Driver Basics
	
•	C programming. We should have some in-depth knowledge of C programming is needed, like pointer usage, bit manipulating functions, structure ,function pointers etc.
•	Microprocessor programming. It is necessary to know how microcomputers work internally: memory addressing, interrupts,bus lining, I/O  etc. All of these concepts should be familiar to an assembler programmer.

	What is Device Driver:
Its normally a piece of  C code that interact with a perticular type of device ( like usb, RS232,LCD,parallal port,keyboard, mouse,ps2 etc), that attach to a computer.

Here for writing a device driver one is not bound to know the presice details of a hardware that is being used.
Also writing a device driver requires an in-depth understanding how the hardwares and softwares worked togather for a perticular device.

Here our discussion is about only Linux device drivers. So  we will write the codes for Linux embedded devices(like x86, ARM ) only.

Some best refference Books:
1.	Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition.

2.	Linux kernel development by Robert Love.

3.	Essential linux device drivers.

Requirments for Writing a basic Device Driver or Module:

1 Required  Ubuntu 14.04 or Fedora 20

2Very fundamental concepts on Hardware.
3Strong knoledge in C programming .

4Expertise with some basics Linux commands

5Writing of Makefile
